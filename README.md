# Advanced SQL Analysis & Optimization Exercises (SQL Server)

This repository contains an **advanced SQL-only project** focused on
**data analysis, data modeling, and query optimization** using
**Microsoft SQL Server**.

The project demonstrates the ability to analyze complex relational datasets,
understand table relationships, and answer business questions using **efficient SQL queries**.

## Development Environment

All queries were developed and executed in a **remote Microsoft SQL Server environment**,
connected to a dedicated SQL Server instance provided by **Analiza College**
as part of a Data Science training program.
